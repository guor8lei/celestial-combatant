# Celestial Combatant

This is a simple Helicoper-esque Android game that I created as a side project in high school. The player controls a spaceship attempting to navigate through and dodge lasers while also collecting orbs.

## Playing the Game

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/guor8lei/celestial-combatant.git`
2. Open up Android Studio
3. Click on `File >> Open`
4. Select the `celestial-combatant` folder that you just cloned
6. Play the app on an emulator or your own Android phone
